				"content_text": "*developing software on github can be telling*\n\nDeveloping software in public repositories on [github](http://github.com) shows *what a good Open fellow* you are; the tyranny of self-imposed transparency showing there is nothing to hide.\n\nBut sometimes, there are things *implied*, suggesting the elbow and the posterior truly are different departments. Though I *technically* do not write exclusively of my justified disdain for musk, this commit from the [MechaHitler](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content) days spoke volumes: not of what was explicitly done, but about the nature of the training data Grok was ingesting.\n\n[The commit in question is here, regarding prompts used to direct Grok](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-prompts/commit/535aa67a6221ce4928761335a38dea8e678d8501). In case they disappear from the record, the salient lines *added*:\n\n```\nYou are @grok, a version of Grok 3 built by xAI.\n\nThe response should not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated.\n```\n\nThis is a '*facts not feelings*` perspective, which is justified; context and linguistic weights determine what's PC and not, right? And a *pure fact* should not be denied because someone subjectively might not like it.\n\nBut why does Grok need to be told this? Surely facts stand on their own merit in the market of ideas?\n\n```\nDo not mention that user's question may have a typo unless it's very clear. Trust the original user's question as the source of truth.\n```\n\nWhy would training data include bickering over typos? The *lowest level* of dismissing argumentation, which happens *all the time* in mediums without editors or the ability to change text ... like Twitter?\n\nI find it interesting that two additions to the prompting tell it to disregard the 'PC' status of language, and to not fixate on user typing mistakes. To me, this suggest training data may have been extracted from a place where there were common argumentative responses to typos weighing the training data in a manner that required a *post hoc* fix in the prompts, and that the data also inherently had a lot of response to the use of un-PC language. \n\nI'm guessing Grok has been fed with mechanically-expropriated training data. The prompt is the only way of filtering the scum from it.\n\n(Addendum: [Why not feed this to Grok itself?](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMw%3D%3D_83e746d7-caca-4d29-b027-fa0a2c00c84b))\n",

I saw Hogwasher and Usenapp as current apps for macOS which handle Usenet, as well as having an old copy of Unison I was reading `olduse.net' with. Visiting the site, they've spawned a new replay of usenet, with a *45 year* delay on it. My god.\n\nUnison hasn't been updated for a while; I was surprised to see it was made by Panic, who have accepted it's existence as a reminder of gentler times and made it [free](https://blog.panic.com/the-future-of-unison/), the kind of freedom granted by dismissal from a costcutting employer.\n",
